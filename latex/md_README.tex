hello from Kels

B\+U\+I\+L\+D\+I\+NG E\+L\+A\+S\+T\+IC S\+E\+A\+R\+C\+H!

Elastic search uses gradle to compile. In order to build the project, you will have to install gradle alongside the J\+DK.

I\+N\+S\+T\+A\+L\+L\+I\+NG G\+R\+A\+D\+LE (Mac OS X instructions).

On the Terminal, check the version of your J\+DK by entering the command\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}javac -version
\end{DoxyVerb}


If you recieve an error message, you will have to ensure that J\+DK or J\+RE is installed.

Go to \href{http://gradle.org/gradle-download/}{\tt http\+://gradle.\+org/gradle-\/download/} to download gradle (the first option, \char`\"{}complete distribution\char`\"{}, is recommended). Unzip the file.

At this point, ensure you\textquotesingle{}re on the admin user directory on the terminal. The current directory on your terminal should look like this (using mine as example.)\+: host37-\/163\+:$\sim$ ogbonnayacngwu\$ The \char`\"{}$\sim$\char`\"{} should be before your name

Enter the following command on your terminal\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}mkdir gradle
\end{DoxyVerb}


Go to finder, open this folder. Copy the unzipped downloaded gradle folder (it should have this name gradle-\/2.\+10) and paste it in the gradle folder.

On the terminal, enter this command\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}export PATH=/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/X11/bin
\end{DoxyVerb}


then enter\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}$PATH 
\end{DoxyVerb}


If you do not see the above P\+A\+TH, enter\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}echo $PATH
\end{DoxyVerb}


if you do not see it, try exporting it again. Alternatively (I don\textquotesingle{}t recommend doing this), you can enter it by opening the bash profile using the command\+: touch $\sim$/.bash\+\_\+profile; open $\sim$/.bash\+\_\+profile

!!!(avoid doing this)!!!\+To force the .bash\+\_\+profile to execute, use\+: source $\sim$/.bash\+\_\+profile

if you saw the P\+A\+TH, after using the P\+A\+TH diaplayer above, enter the following command (Again, I\textquotesingle{}m using my own directory as example, ensure you use the actual ones for yours)\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}export PATH=/Users/ogbonnayacngwu/gradle/gradle-2.10/bin:$PATH
\end{DoxyVerb}


To ensure the P\+A\+TH was added, use the \char`\"{}\$\+P\+A\+T\+H\char`\"{} or \char`\"{}echo \$\+P\+A\+T\+H\char`\"{}

Make sure the P\+A\+TH was added before you proceed.

You will then have to add J\+A\+V\+A\+\_\+\+H\+O\+ME to the location of your J\+DK. You will have to see where your J\+DK is installed. For instance mine is installed in the Libraries/\+Java/\+Java\+Virtual\+Machines/jdk1.\+8\+\_\+11.\+jdk/\+Contents/\+Home. Hence, I will link my J\+A\+V\+A\+\_\+\+H\+O\+ME to the location using the command\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}export JAVA_HOME=/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk1.8.0_11.jdk/Contents/Home
\end{DoxyVerb}


Now, you can check if gradle is linked using the command\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}gradle -version
\end{DoxyVerb}


You should see the following output\+: 

 \subsection*{Gradle 2.\+10 }

Build time\+: 2015-\/12-\/21 21\+:15\+:04 U\+TC Build number\+: none Revision\+: 276bdcded730f53aa8c11b479986aafa58e124a6

Groovy\+: 2.\+4.\+4 Ant\+: Apache Ant(\+T\+M) version 1.\+9.\+3 compiled on December 23 2013 J\+VM\+: 1.\+8.\+0\+\_\+11 (Oracle Corporation 25.\+11-\/b03) OS\+: Mac OS X 10.\+11.\+2 x86\+\_\+64

If you recieve the folloeing error message, you will have to get the right location for J\+DK and export J\+A\+V\+A\+\_\+\+H\+O\+ME again.

E\+R\+R\+OR\+: J\+A\+V\+A\+\_\+\+H\+O\+ME is set to an invalid directory\+: /\+Users/\+Java/\+Java\+Virtual\+Machines/jdk1.8.\+0\+\_\+11

Please set the J\+A\+V\+A\+\_\+\+H\+O\+ME variable in your environment to match the location of your Java installation.

To build and run the project; navigate to the project directory using change directory on the terminal. Enter this command\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}gradle run
\end{DoxyVerb}


It will download all the plugin required by the jar files, then it will build the project and run it!
